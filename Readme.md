# Analyze Rice Production 2020-2022

## Overview
This project aims to analyze the trends in rice production in Indonesia from 2020 to 2022. The analysis is conducted to gain insights into the fluctuations in rice production and to understand the potential implications for food security in Indonesia.

## Objectives
- To identify and visualize the annual trends in rice production.
- To explore any significant variations or patterns in rice production over the years.
- To provide a basis for further analysis on factors influencing rice production in Indonesia.

## Data Source
The data used for this analysis is sourced from Indonesian Central Bureau of Statistics (https://www.bps.go.id/), a reputable organization that collects and publishes agricultural data. The dataset includes information on rice production by region, year, and other relevant variables.

## Methodology
Performed data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and data visualization to achieve the project objectives. Python libraries, such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, were used for data analysis and visualization.

## Key Findings
- The visualization reveals a fluctuating pattern in rice production from 2020 to 2022.

## Implications and Relevance
Understanding the dynamics of rice production is crucial for addressing food security issues in Indonesia. The insights from this analysis can be used to make informed decisions about agricultural policies and resource allocation.

## Next Steps
- Further analysis can be conducted to identify the factors influencing the fluctuations in rice production.
- It is recommended to investigate the impact of weather patterns, government policies, and technological advancements on rice production.
